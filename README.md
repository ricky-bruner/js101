# Basic JS

## Chapter 9 Function Practice

The jspractice directory houses another main.js file that contains all of my practice assignment work for Chapter 9. Within, I have copy and pasted that practice work given, commented out the details, and placed my work below. As I worked through the "overly-excited" portion of the practice, I chose to change variable and arument names subtly so that I could see all of the work represented in the console at once, and have all versions of the code present to refer back to.
